Atom dotfiles
=============
These are my Atom editor config.  Atom is dead and I haven't been using it in a while, so these are not really in use anymore.  However, if you want to use it, you can install Atom packages by running:

``` sh
apm install --packages-file ~/.dotfiles/atom/packages.txt
```

and update list with:

``` sh
apm list --installed --bare > ~/.dotfiles/atom/packages.txt
```
